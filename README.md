Gaussian Naive Bayes on Spiral Multiclass Dataset

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the behaviour of the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier on a challenging spiral-shaped multiclass dataset. The spiral dataset is intentionally nonlinear, making it a great example to visualise the limitations of Naive Bayes, which assumes Gaussian distributions and feature independence.

The project includes:

Preprocessing with StandardScaler

Training/testing split for evaluation

Gaussian Naive Bayes classification

Visualisation of dataset scatter plot and decision boundaries

Accuracy evaluation

 
Features
Load and preprocess a custom dataset (spiral_multiclass_dataset.csv)

Feature scaling for balanced training

Train/test split for robust evaluation

Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB)

Visualisation of:

Dataset scatter plot (neutral colours)

Decision boundary with soft colour regions

Accuracy score printed in the console
